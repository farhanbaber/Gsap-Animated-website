 3D Earbuds Website
This repository contains the source code for a 3D interactive website showcasing a pair of wireless earbuds. The project was built to demonstrate my skills in creating an immersive, high-performance web experience using modern front-end technologies. üéß

React: The foundational front-end library used to build the user interface and manage application state.

Tailwind CSS: For fast and efficient styling of the website's UI.

‚ú® Features
Interactive 3D Model: Users can freely rotate, zoom, and pan the earbud model.

Dynamic Lighting: The scene includes realistic lighting and shadows that react to user interaction.

Responsive Design: The website provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Performance Optimized: The scene is optimized for smooth rendering and fast load times.
